    "description": "Multiplexed dscRNA-seq was used to characterize the cell-type specificity and inter-individual variability of response to IFN-\u03b2, a potent cytokine that induces genome-scale changes in the transcriptional profiles of immune cells. From each of eight lupus patients, PBMCs were activated with recombinant IFN-\u03b2 or left untreated for 6 h, a time point previously found to maximize the expression of interferon-sensitive genes in dendritic cells and T cells16,17. Two pools, IFN-\u03b2-treated and control, were prepared with the same number of cells from each individual and loaded onto the 10\u00d7 Chromium instrument. Cells with fewer than 500 genes detected were remove, leaving 14,039 single cells in total. Genes were reduced to 1410 most variable genes according to dispersion. This reduced data set is used as an example of Seurat alignment workflow (see link below).",
