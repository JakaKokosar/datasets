    "description": "This dataset is a slightly modified version of the dataset provided in the StatLib library. In line with the use by Ross Quinlan (1993) in predicting the attribute 'mpg', 8 of the original instances were removed because they had unknown values for the 'mpg' attribute. The original dataset is available in the file 'auto-mpg.data-original'. 'The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon, to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous attributes.'' (Quinlan, 1993)",
