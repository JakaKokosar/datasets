    "description": "This is a synthetic data set derived from a simple hierarchical decision model to demonstrate decision support system DEX (see Bohanec and Rajkovic). The decision model included six attributes, including buying and maintenance price, the number of passengers, size of the luggage booth, and evaluated the utility of the car from a buyer's perspective. All attributes were discrete, having from three to four values. The data set provides car's utility for all possible combinations of attribute values. The data set was originally created to showcase the ability of machine learning by function decomposition to recreate the hierarchy of the decision model.",
